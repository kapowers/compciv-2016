## Gender Detector
# Introduction
I will be using a handmade CSV to analyze the genders of all the guests on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah (2015-2016). I want to better understand potential gender disparities between the guests that Trevor Noah books for his show. My sense is that he books more men than women, but this will provide me with more evidence to go by.

(Later: What I found)

# Methodology and Caveats
I created my own CSV for this project. I copied and pasted all the information of guests from [this Wikipedia page listing Trevor Noah's guest for part of 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Daily_Show_episodes_(2015)#2015_.28under_Noah.29) 
and [this Wikipedia page of his guests thus far in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Daily_Show_episodes_(2016))

I will analyze about 300 records. I will try to separate the names of the record such as Joe Doe to just 'John' and then classify that gender. I will split the name using a gender_analysis function that I will create to split and then only classify the first elemtnin the list.

PUT PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED HERE.
